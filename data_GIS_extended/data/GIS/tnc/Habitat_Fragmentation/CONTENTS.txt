## Description
Magnitude of habitat fragmentation indicated by largest patch size, by terrestrial ecoregion.  
  
We considered agriculture, urban infrastructure, roads, and railroads as &quot;fragmenting&quot; features to the landscape and areas not converted to agriculture, urban infrastructure, roads, or railroads as &quot;nonfragmented&quot; terrestrial landscape patches. We used input spatial data from JRC&#39;s GLC 2000 (2003), CIESIN et al. (2004), Defense Mapping Agency (1992), and South American Conservation Region (2005). To produce the data, we constructed a global map grid of fragmenting features (Mollweide projection, based on the WGS 1984 datum; 1 km2 resolution); this grid was then combined with the GLC 2000, adding a new &quot;fragmenting features&quot; class to the GLC 2000 map. We then extracted a window around the area of each ecoregion in a way that avoided truncating landscape patches with the ecoregion boundary, and measured landscape fragmentation characteristics using Fragstats (McGarigal et al. 2002). The map shows one of these characteristics: the largest patch size by ecoregion.  
  
These data were derived by The Nature Conservancy, and were displayed in a map published in The Atlas of Global Conservation (Hoekstra et al., University of California Press, 2010). More information at http://nature.org/atlas.

### Attribute Data

AREA    AREA    Area of each individual polygon in square kilometers.  The attribute area_km2 is a sum of this field for each ecoregion as a whole.    
BIOME    BIOME    Biome name    
ECO_ID    ECO_ID    This number is created by combining REALM, BIOME, and ECO_NUM, thus creating a unique numeric ID for each ecoregion.    
ECO_NAME    ECO_NAME    Ecoregion Name    
ECO_NUM    ECO_NUM    A unique number for each ecoregion within each biome nested within each realm.    
FID    FID    Internal feature number.    
fragmntndx    fragmntndx    magnitude of habitat fragmentation     
OBJECTID    OBJECTID    Internal feature number.    
PERIMETER    PERIMETER    total distance of the ecoregion    
REALM    REALM    Biogeographical Realm    
Shape    Shape    Feature geometry.
