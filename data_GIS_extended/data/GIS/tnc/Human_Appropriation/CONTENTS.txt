## Description
Human appropriation of net primary productivity, by terrestrial ecoregion.  
  
We derived the map showing the amount of carbon fixed by photosynthesis and then consumed by humans from Imhoff et al. (2004a). A zonal sum procedure was applied to the gridded version of those data to summarize by ecoregion.  
  
These data were derived by The Nature Conservancy, and were displayed in a map published in The Atlas of Global Conservation (Hoekstra et al., University of California Press, 2010). More information at http://nature.org/atlas.

### Attribute Data

AREA    AREA    Area of each individual polygon in square kilometers.  The attribute area_km2 is a sum of this field for each ecoregion as a whole.    
BIOME    BIOME    Biome name    
ECO_CODE    ECO_CODE    unique code that uses realm text, biome number and ecoregion number.    
ECO_ID    ECO_ID    This number is created by combining REALM, BIOME, and ECO_NUM, thus creating a unique numeric ID for each ecoregion.    
ECO_NAME    ECO_NAME    Ecoregion Name    
ECO_NUM    ECO_NUM    A unique number for each ecoregion within each biome nested within each realm.    
ECO_SYM    ECO_SYM    Ecoregion Symbol - Used to display the map in ArcInfo    
FID    FID    Internal feature number.    
HumAppIndx    HumAppIndx    Index of human appropriation of net primary productivity, by terrestrial ecoregion.    
OBJECTID    OBJECTID    Internal feature number.    
PERIMETER    PERIMETER    total distance of the ecoregion    
REALM    REALM    Biogeographical Realm    
Shape    Shape    Feature geometry.
