# Description
Accessibility of natural habitats to humans, by terrestrial ecoregion.  
  
The human accessibility map provides an index of the level of effort it would take for a human on foot to access any given square kilometer of nonconverted land from existing infrastructure. We calculated human accessibility from a one-square-kilometer spatial grid of the terrestrial world consisting of a cost surface where the value of each cell was derived from topographic slope, vegetation type, and vegetation density. We developed a second matching spatial grid of infrastructure, depicting roads, railroads, navigable rivers, cities, and towns. Then we calculated a least cost path from each noninfrastructure grid cell to infrastructure grid cells. Agricultural areas were given a cost value of zero. Accessibility scores for ecoregions were taken as the mean human access value per ecoregion.  
  
The amount of the terrestrial world falling within ten kilometers of a road was calculated from a base map of roads from the Digital Chart of the World (Defense Mapping Agency 1992) that had been variously updated with more recent road maps. Roads were buffered by ten kilometers, and the total buffered area was divided by the total terrestrial area. The 61 percent figure is likely conservative.  
  
These data were derived by The Nature Conservancy, and were displayed in a map published in The Atlas of Global Conservation (Hoekstra et al., University of California Press, 2010). More information at http://nature.org/atlas.
