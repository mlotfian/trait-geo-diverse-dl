DNN performance
===========

The performance metrics of the pilot DNN model can be found in the [DNN_eval.txt](DNN_eval.txt) file and are visualized in the png files in the folder which show the change in test loss, accuracy, AUC and uncertainty around the estimated AUC value (shown below) with increasing sample size.
