SDM results
===========

The results are divided into three sections: (i) the results per species, (ii) outlying mean index, (iii) the combinations of results. The results per species folder contain the maxent results, a map with raw occurence data, variable importance, response curve and predicted niche maps. The outlying mean index folder contains the a table with the OMI values per species, a table with normalized site traits per species and a table with the raw site traits per species. The combination of results folder contains a csv file with niche overlap between the different species and dendrograms based on the combination of niche overlaps and site traits. 

- Results per species [Species list](per_species)
- Outlying mean index [OMI tables](OMI)
- Combinations of results [Dendrograms](maxent)
