# trait-geo-diverse-dl

This repository develops the application of deep learning to ecological niche
modelling (ENM-DL). The repository consists of three sub-projects:

- [pilot](pilot) - contains the same occurrences and GIS data as used in the
  [classic ENM](https://github.com/naturalis/trait-geo-diverse-ungulates) project.
  The purpose of this subproject is to assess the performance of ENM-DL in a
  like for like comparison with MaxEnt modelling.
- [data_extended](data_extended) - incorporates additional occurrence data. The
  purpose of this project is to develop insight into the number of occurrences
  that needs to be collected for credible modelling.
